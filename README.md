# Geoguessr BlackJack
> Discord Bot to mantain a blackjack game of geoguessr, where users are to accumulate points in between two scores.  Bot calculates who came in between these two, while also tracking the users who have entered already, as you need to play each round

Idea of game is that round 1 starts off with two scores i.e. (3,000 - 15,000), and each successive round the scores get closer i.e. (5,000 - 15,000) so there is one winner at the end.  The bot tracks users  along the wya, so you need to have been in a prior round to show on the score list in the next round.

Here's an example of one round, with the remaining users sent over through discord:

Here's the example score set, as you can see only the players who scored between 14,000 - 15,000 and were safe in a previous round are counted in this round
